### External Services Verification

- **Facebook Domain Verification**: A meta tag has been added to `index.html` to verify the domain with Meta (Facebook) services.
    - Tag: `<meta name="facebook-domain-verification" content="..." />`
    - Location: `public/index.html` (or root `index.html` in Vite).

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a strictly layered architecture. Please refer to [src/README.md](./src/README.md) for a detailed breakdown of the folder structure and design principles.

## 🌍 Ecosystem & Full Stack Overview

This project is a **Hybrid Single Page Application (SPA)** that relies on a robust Serverless Backend.

-   **Frontend (`src/`):** React + Vite. Handles UI, Client State, and optimistic updates.
-   **Backend (`functions/`):** Google Cloud Functions. Acts as the **secure driver** for critical business logic (e.g., Role Promotion, Payments, Sensitive Data Aggregation).
    > **Security Note:** Never put sensitive business rules (pricing algorithms, role changes) solely in the frontend. Always maintain a mirror or driver in `functions/`.

Please refer to [src/README.md](./src/README.md) for a detailed breakdown of the folder structure and design principles.

### Key Directories
- **`src/`**: Frontend application (Vite + React).
- **`functions/`**: Backend logic (Firebase Cloud Functions in TypeScript).
- **`src/services/`**: Business logic and external communication.
- **`src/repositories/`**: Data transformation and abstraction.
- **`src/types/`**: Data definitions and models.
- **`src/components/`**: UI components (Atomic Design).
- **`src/screens/`**: Application pages/views.
- **`src/hooks/`**: ViewModels and logic encapsulation.
